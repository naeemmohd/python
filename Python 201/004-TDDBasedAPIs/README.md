### Test Driven Development of RESTfulAPIs:
  * Test Driven Development sia development depending on test cases
  * You develop code based on satisying a test case
  * A proper test case should handle good, bad and ugly data
  * Lets re-visit Products API- it should have following features:
  * Feature | HTTP Verb | Resource | Test Example 
    ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
    add new products | POST | /product/<productname>  | http://127.0.0.1:5000/product/HP360
    get a list of products | GET | /products | http://127.0.0.1:5000/products
    get a specific product by name | GET | /product/<productname> | http://127.0.0.1:5000/product/HP360
    update a product | PUT | /product/<productname> | http://127.0.0.1:5000/product/HP360
    delete a product | DELETE | /product/<productname> | http://127.0.0.1:5000/product/HP360
  * Lets create these endpoints in postman so that we can test the APIs as we develop

### First TDD based RESTful API Version 1:
  * Here is the code for the TDD based RESTful API:
  * Please notice a few new things we are doing here
    * See this statement : ***return {'product': None}, 404***
    * We are not only retuning a valid JSON but also a 404 status code when a product is not found
    * Similarly -
    * See this statement : ***return product, 201***  
    * Also
    * See this statement : ***data = request.get_json()***  
    * See how we are using the request object to retrive data from request body
    * We are not only retuning a valid JSON but also a 201 status code when a product is created
    * Also see below how we replaced a for loop with a filter function
      * the loop replaced by filter function to filter the list
      * also use either list to rerurn mone, one oor many items in the list
      * or return exactly one or none item
      * product = next(filter(lambda x: x['name'] == name, products), None)
      * also,
      * return {'product': product}, 200 if product else 404
      * in above method we are returning product, status code 200 if product exists else 404z
