### Python - Debugging:
  * **Regular Expressions**:
    * used effectively in lot of tasks like data clean up, parsing data, pattern matching
    * Python uses a module ‘re’ for regular expressions
    * How to search : match = **re.match(searchword, searchsource)** returns a boolean
    * How to find location of search : **match.start()** and **match.end()** return the start and end locations of the search
    * How to find all instances of a search word : all = **re.findall(searchword, searchsource)**
    * are used to text matching or parsing
    
  * Create a file - 01-Basics-RegularExpressions01.py:

    
    ```
    import re
    searchwords =['Redis', 'port', 'server']
    logdata = 'Redis version=4.0.9, bits=64, pid=1, just started, Redis Running mode=standalone, port=6379.'
    for searchword in searchwords:
        print('Searching word: "%s" in log: "%s".' %(searchword, logdata))
        match = re.search(searchword, logdata)
        if(match):
            print('Successfully searched word: "%s", match start: %d, match end: %d' %(searchword, match.start(), match.end()))
        else:
            print('Could not search word: "%s"' %(searchword))

  * **Meta Characters**:
    * meta-character * means pattern must appear zero or more times.
    * meta-character + means pattern must appear at least once.
    * meta-character ? means pattern must appears zero or one time.
    * meta-character {x} means pattern must appears x number of times
    * meta-character {x, y } means pattern must appears x to y number of times in a range
